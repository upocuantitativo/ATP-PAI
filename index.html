                        <h3>Research Context</h3>
                        <p>The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in tourism is profoundly transforming travel planning and experience delivery. AI offers significant potential for improving accessibility; however, its uncritical application may generate new dynamics of exclusion. Despite growing interest in both accessible tourism and AI-driven tourism, <strong>very few studies integrate both fields in a critical and systematic manner</strong> (Korbiel et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025).</p>

                        <h3>The TAP-IAP Model</h3>
                        <p>The <strong>TAP-IAP model</strong> (<em>Turismo Accesible Potenciado por Inteligencia Artificial Personalizada</em> / Accessible Tourism Powered by Personalized AI) is a conceptual framework designed to analyze and guide the design of inclusive tourism experiences mediated by intelligent systems. Its objective is to orient the design, governance, and evaluation of tourism technologies from a perspective centered on the <strong>rights, autonomy, and dignity</strong> of persons with functional diversity.</p>

                        <h3>Purpose of This Tool</h3>
                        <p>This proof-of-concept operationalizes the TAP-IAP model as an <strong>interactive decision-support and ex ante evaluation tool</strong>, illustrating its practical applicability. It materializes the theoretical framework into functional modules: accessible profiling, explainable algorithmic personalization, bias review, and an indicator dashboard with scenario comparison &mdash; preparing the ground for future empirical research including co-design with persons with disabilities, usability studies, and pilot studies at destinations.</p>

                                <strong>Methodological Note.</strong> This tool does not constitute exhaustive empirical validation, but rather a functional translation of the conceptual framework oriented toward exploring its internal coherence, implementation potential, and the hypotheses that could be tested in future research (Snyder, 2019). The research adopts an exploratory and propositional methodology based on a critical literature review spanning digital tourism, accessibility, disability studies, and algorithmic ethics.

They serve as <em>evaluable hypotheses</em> and design criteria for future empirical validation through co-design with persons with disabilities, usability studies, and pilot implementations at tourism destinations (Snyder, 2019; Dickson et al., 2024).
